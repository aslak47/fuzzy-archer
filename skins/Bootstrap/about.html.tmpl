            <h2>How it's done</h2>
            <p>This website summarises weather data logged by a weather station using the polished and highly
                customisable
                <A href="http://weewx.com">Weewx</a> software (version $station.version). Weewx downloads a data record
                from the
                weatherstation every 5 minutes and stores it in an archive database.
                It also creates all the graphs and webpages which are uploaded to the website every 5 minutes.</p>

            <p>This website uses a custom skin which uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to deal with
                most
                of the layout and presentation. The gauges and the history tables are generated by Python scripts which
                hook
                into Weewx.</p>

            <p>The code for gauge rendering (gaugeengine.py) and history table generation (historygenerator.py)
                can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer">github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer</a>
            </p>

            <p>Web content is stored in public_html/Bootstrap.
            <p>

            <p>The easiest way to install this skin is to download the source archive from GitHub:
                <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases">releases</a>, and use the Weewx installer
                to unpack it:</p>

            <pre>wee_extension --install [wherever you've put the archive]</pre>

            <p>Set the page title and footer through the <code>[BootstrapLabels]</code> section in
                <code>skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf</code>. Change the template language using the [Language] section in
                <code>skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf</code> and <code>skins/Images/skin.conf</code></p>
