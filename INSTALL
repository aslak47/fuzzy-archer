Installation
============

Before we begin...
 1) This release (v4.4) has been tested on Weewx version 5.1.0 and Python 3.12.3
 2) This has been tested on sqlite databases. Mysql and any other Weewx supported databases should work too.

Basic installation - The easy way
===========================

1) Get hold of the release archive from github:   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

2) Install it using the Weewx extension installer.

  a) If you used the Debian installer:
       sudo wee_extension --install=[wherever you've put the archive]

  b) If you have installed weewx yourself:
       cd /home/weewx [or where your base install is]
       bin/wee_extension --install=[wherever you've put the archive]


Web content is stored in public_html/Bootstrap, if not specified otherwise.

3) Set the page title and page footer through the "Page Title" and "Footer Text" key in the [Texts] section of skins/Bootstrap/lang/xx.conf.

    If you want to have any other tags availabe to the templates, add them in [Extras] in skin.conf:
    [Extras]

        location_href = ["#" for nothing, or a hyperlink to some more information on your location]

4) Installing multiple languages at the same time

    Simply out a skin configuration item for each language in weewx.conf:

    [StdReport]

        [[Bootstrap-en]]
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html/weewx/Bootstrap/en
            lang = en
            enable = true

        [[Bootstrap-de]]
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html/weewx/Bootstrap/de
            lang = de
            enable = true

        [[Bootstrap-cn]]
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html/weewx/Bootstrap/cn
            lang = cn
            enable = true
5) Live Gauges and Charts

    For enabling the Live Updates dowload and install weewx-mqtt: https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-mqtt and
    make sure you have the binding set to "loop" in weewx.conf :

    [StdRESTful]
        [[MQTT]]
            server_url = "url_to_your_mqtt_server" # e.g.: mqtts://username:password@myserver.com:8883/
            topic = weather
            binding = loop
            aggregation = aggregate

    In Bootstrap/skin.conf configure the frontend client, protocol will be ws or wss for unecrypted/encrypted
    wbebsocket client. Warning! This Data is exposed to the frontend! Configure your account in a safe way, for instance
    create a token with read-only access to the topic. See also examples in skin.conf.

    [JSONGenerator]
        [[MQTT]]
            [[[connections]]]
                [[[[my_mqtt]]]]
                    broker_connection = wss://myserver.com:443 # wss (encrypted)
                    mqtt_username = my_public_token # data is exposed to frontend! make sure you use data that is not confidential, like tokens with ACL
                    mqtt_password = my_public_token # data is exposed to frontend! make sure you use data that is not confidential, like tokens with ACL
                    [[[[[topics]]]]]
                          # JSON topics hold their value(s) in a JSON object. Every key can be matched to a gauge/chart dataset will work with weewx-mqtt, see: https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/mqtt
                          [[[[[[weather/loop]]]]]]
                              type = JSON

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1) I've installed the new skin but I only see the original Weewx pages.
     This template does not overwrite any existing templates which are generated in weewx.conf. For a new Weewwx
     installation, both the standard Weewx and the Bootstrap reports will be generated:
         Standard template:  http://[wherever your site is]
         Bootstrap template: http://[wherever your site is]/Bootstrap

     If you no longer want to generate the standard weewx template, comment out this section in weewx.conf:
         [StdReport]
             # [[StandardReport]]
             # skin = Standard

2) I can see the static day, week, month and year graphs but cannot see the live graphs or gauges.
    The live gauges cannot connect to live readings over a file:// browser connection.
    One easy way view live gauges and charts on a local filesystem is to run a simple python webserver from your
    public_html folder and connect to that using your browser:
      cd [location of your weewx public_html folder]
      python -m http.server 8080

      In your browser, connect to http://localhost:8080/Bootstrap
